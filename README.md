# Point of View
You create a multiverse. You create branches. Lots of branches. You make mistakes.
So many, that it's overwhelming. Things get cluttered. So how do we clean them?

Point of View. Point of view allows you to show all the branches you want.

For example if we create the multiverse...

```
Multiverse_1: Current POV
    Cats/mylizard.jpg
    Dogs/myPotato.jpg
```
          
you notice that "mylizard.jpg" and "myPotato.jpg" are in the wrong places. 
                    
```
Multiverse_1: Current POV
    Cats/mylizard.jpg
    Dogs/myPotato.jpg
    Multiverse_2: Created to put correct photos in correct locations 
        Cats/mycat.jpg
        Dogs/mydog.jpg
```
